# OneSeen - Secret Confessions & One-Time Messages

## Features
- 🔒 **Complete Anonymity** – No login required for confessions.
- 📩 **One-Time Secret Messages** – Messages auto-delete after being read.
- ⏳ **Timer-Based Expiry** – Unopened messages expire in 24 hours.

- 🛡 **Privacy-Focused** – No data storage, no tracking, no logs.
